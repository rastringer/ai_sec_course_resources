# Welcome!

This is a course to teach developers - whether hobbyist, students, or professionals - enough about machine learning (ML) and ML security that they can contribute to the field and successfully help to mitigate AI risk in their studies, projects and careers.

## What are the prerequisites?

It's recommended that participants have at least one year of programming experience, preferably in Python.

## Do I need to know ML already?

No, the course was designed to be as accessible as possible to developers in a variety of fields. If you work as a software developer, data scientist, SRE, web developer, infrastructure engineer, security engineer or other roles, there are likely to be applications of what you learn in the course to your work. The material helps build and intuitive understanding of ML before we go on to more complex topics. 

If you are already an experienced ML engineer and wish to learn more about the security side of the field, you're welcome to skip the 'Introduction to ML' module.

## What does it cost?

## Why take this over other courses?

There are many brilliant and useful resources out there. The focus of this course is ML security with a lighter treatment of the topic of *safety*, since one field can generally cause issues for the other. It is hands-on, with practical implementation of just about every theory discussed in the course, so it's suitable for those who like to experiment, write code, and work on their own projects.

If you're more interested in AI safety fields such as alignment, governance, policy or interpretability, these courses are very worthwhile:

* [Arena](https://www.arena.education/) for extensive coverage of machine learning and mech interp.

* [Blue Dot Impact's](https://bluedot.org/) governance, alignment and other courses.
