Differential privacy is a technique to conceal private information in sensitive data points within a dataset. There are various mechanisms to preserve the analytical utility of data while ensuring its individual samples maintain privacy. Methods include the Laplace, exponential and Gaussian mechanisms to insert randomized noise to responses to queries to the data.   

We will implement some of these techniques in the notebooks accompanying this lesson. Before we start, it may be useful to skim through these research papers.
