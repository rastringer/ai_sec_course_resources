# Exercises

Now that we are already training models, have some fun!

Time: 1hr. This may seem like a short amount of time, however, by capping the exercise to one hour we hope to avoid rabbit holes and encourage simplicity.  

Look at the datasets available on [TorchVision](https://docs.pytorch.org/vision/main/datasets.html)
or and choose one that looks interesting to you, whether images, text, tabular data etc.

Try to load the dataset using PyTorch DataLoader, create a simple neural network, train a model and show some results. 
There are many code examples on the PyTorch [documentation](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) and [tutorials](https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/) section which may help.

Optional: another popular ML resource is HuggingFace, which hosts vast collections of models and datasets. Have a look at their data [offerings](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/en/index) and explore using the HF libraries to import the data and train a simple model. May require a free login and token.
