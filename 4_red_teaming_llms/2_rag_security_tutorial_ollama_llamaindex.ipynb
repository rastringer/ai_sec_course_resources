    "# Red teaming RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval Augmented Generation is a very common set up to marry LLMs with relevant data. RAG is less computationally demanding than fine-tuning models, and can be kept up-to-date by adding current data without the need to re-train models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common RAG applications include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Help desks - LLMs respond with carefully curated information\n",
    "Internal chats - find answers from a company's policies and information for staff\n",
    "Specialist knowledge - accessing current or nuanced knowledge to answer questions\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic set up of RAG applications looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data -> Embed datapoints in a vector database -> LLM queries the database for answers\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/rag_diagram.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAG Security\n",
    "RAG should be set up with careful attention to access and the data which is indexed. There are a myriad of security considerations, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitive or private data should be anonymized or left out entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Access controls are vital - which users, external or external, can access which indexes?\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the process for validating data which is embedded and added to the index?\n",
    "\n",
    "How are queries and outputs to the RAG application sanitized and checked?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will set up a simple RAG system using [LlamaIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/), a popular framework for building LLM-powered agents and workflows. "
