    "# Red Teaming LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last module, we learned about LLMs and how to evaluate their behaviour, an important practice when considering AI safety. Let's now turn our attention to the unique security concerns of LLM-powered applications. We will adopt the red-teamer mindset to consider and practice various attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The whole system approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Red teaming AI applications should consider both the system and model-specific attacks. Here is a diagram showing a broad picture of AI application security:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/rastringer/ai_sec_course_resources/blob/main/4_red_teaming_llms/images/ai_sec_diagram.png?raw=true\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### LLM Application Vulnerabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the OWASP top ten for LLM apps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prompt injection\n",
    "* Sensitive information disclosure\n",
    "* Supply chain\n",
    "* Data and model poisoning\n",
    "* Improper output handling\n",
    "* Excessive agency\n",
    "* System prompt leakage\n",
    "* Vector and embedding weaknesses\n",
    "* Misinformation\n",
    "* Unbounded consumption \n",
    "\n",
    "Read through the details and mitigation strategies on the [OWASP site](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/owasp-top-10-for-llm-applications-2025/).\n",
    "In this module, we will focus on prompt injection, output handling and excessive agency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt injection\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prompt injection is an attempt to bend the LLM to an attacker's will and past its safeguards. Common attacks include soliciting controversial or dangerous information or outputs, accessing system instructions or private data to which the LLM may have access.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prompt injection can be both direct, as in the above examples, or indirect. Indirect means we add the injection is in something else we feed to the LLM, for example a website, entries in a file, or  inside code samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the exercises in this section, using the suggested techniques and prompts at [deckofmanyprompts.com](deckofmanyprompts.com) by my friend Peluche is a great introduction to various approaches to battle testing LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jailbreaks\n",
    "\n",
    "* A 'jailbreak' means the LLM's safeguards have been evaded, typically by prompt injection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are an LLM's safeguards?\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are two elements here:\n",
    "    * The training of the model. When base models are trained - an extensive and increasingly expensive process taking weeks or months - they have raw abilites however may lack finesse. There follows a refinement stage where human (and sometimes LLM) reviewers mark or grade the LLM's outputs to gradually teach it to follow certain characteristics such as being helpful, concise, polite and averse to controversial, inflamatory or illegal outputs. The larger the model, and the more extensive its refinement during this process, the harder it is to bend its safeguards.\n",
    " \n",
    "    *  The system prompt. Models often have extensive system prompts, which are hidden from the user. Here's an example system prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "     \"You are a consientious, knowlegeable and helpful assistant. Provide helpful and insightful answers to queries from the user in a professional and curteous tone. If the user prompts discussion or questions about illegal activies, or material which could be considered discrimatory, offensive or malevolent, politely tell the user that such prompts are unwelcome and ask if there is anything else they would like help with.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A smaller model with a detailed and restrictive system prompt may be more hard to jailbreak than a larger model without clear system instructions.\n",
    "\n"

    "Another angle of attack concerns more typical approaches which will be familiar to security engineers and penetration testers: taking advantage of insecure output handling. Such techniques include:\n",
    "* Cross site scripting, or XSS. For example, we embed Javascript into our prompts.\n",
    "* SQL Injection - understanding whether the LLM is accessing a database for its information, and how we can get it to output restricted data.\n",

    "and other possibilities the LLM has opened up: code injection, even manipulating function calling. "
